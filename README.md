## Before reporting bugs, read the bare-minimum requirements for bug reports
Seriously. It will help every single one of us, including you and - especially - Andrew.

### What?
This place exists so Andrew can just sift through the endless waves of the bugs you dipshits post.  
Yes, even the duplicates. Here's the [game's store page btw](https://store.steampowered.com/app/541200/Get_To_The_Orange_Door)

### Why?
Ciastex originally proposed the idea of this bugtracker way before but "it wasn't required as nobody would use it." Then TieDye made a google doc to track bugs, so - as it made the previous point invalid - the bugtracker creation followed.

### Bare-minimum requirements for reports
When reporting a bug, please use the provided issue template, and if you choose not to, make sure to include all the details you possibly can about the bug you want to report.

**WobbleOps**  
The game's **sole developer**, Andrew. Anything he closes and is not marked as a duplicate, you can fairly safely assume it's fixed. [Created GTTOD, duh](https://store.steampowered.com/app/541200/Get_To_The_Orange_Door).

Moderator on GTTOD official Discord server, as well as this place. His role is to consolidate bug reports found elsewhere, label them and weed out any duplicates.

Moderator on GTTOD official Discord server, as well as this place. Same responsibilities as **TieDyeTopHat**. [Makes GTTOD mods, too](https://github.com/BobTheBob9?tab=repositories). Can provide more accurate data for bug reports but he's lazy.
