### What?
This place exists so Andrew can just sift through the endless waves of the bugs you dipshits post.  
Yes, even the duplicates. Here's the [game's store page btw](https://store.steampowered.com/app/541200/Get_To_The_Orange_Door)

### Why?
Ciastex originally proposed the idea of this bugtracker way before but "it wasn't required as nobody would use it." Then TieDye made a google doc to track bugs, so - as it made the previous point invalid - the bugtracker creation followed.

### Bug tracker maintainers  
Avatars taken from Discord, so you know whose username maps to who on Discord.

The game's **sole developer**, Andrew. Anything he closes and is not marked as a duplicate, you can fairly safely assume it's fixed. [Created GTTOD, duh](https://store.steampowered.com/app/541200/Get_To_The_Orange_Door).

Moderator on GTTOD official Discord server, as well as this place. His role is to consolidate bug reports found elsewhere, label them and weed out any duplicates.

Moderator on GTTOD official Discord server, as well as this place. Same responsibilities as **TieDyeTopHat**. [Makes GTTOD mods, too](https://github.com/BobTheBob9?tab=repositories). Can provide more accurate data for bug reports but he's lazy.

An annoying pimple on GTTOD community's ass. Same responsibilities as **TieDyeTopHat**. Created [Centrifuge](https://github.com/Ciastex/Centrifuge#readme) and [Centrifuge GSL for GTTOD](https://github.com/Ciastex/Centrifuge.GTTOD). Makes GTTOD mods, too. Can provide more accurate data for bug reports - even debug the game itself to do bug hunting - whenever he feels like it.
